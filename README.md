This is a small tutorial to make a automatic hand sanitiser for cheap(for me the cost was only 1500,which is less compared to its market price)
The code is given in the .ino file,Copy it to the arduino ide and upload it to you arduino for it to work

I modified the body of an ordinary wall mounted hand sanitiser to make this product,This case is available for rs .500 in amazon https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07MFLDQQH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Relay,Arduino and wiring have been hot glued to the inner surface of the sanitiser shell

The opening of the tank was made large so that the submersible pumc can be put in thye tank,A hole was made on the tank cap for the outlet pipe to pass through

the pipiing has been taken through the side of the tank and it goes to the bottom where its opening is poshed through the hole which was already present.This end is hot glued inorder to prevent the pipe from getting loose and coming off
